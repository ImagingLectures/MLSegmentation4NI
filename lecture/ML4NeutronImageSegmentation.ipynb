    "#### Resolution\n",
    "The resolution is primarily determined optical transfer function of the imaging system. The actual resolution is given by the extents of the sample and how much the detector needs to capture in one image. This gives the field of view and given the number pixels in the used detector it is possible to calculate the pixel size. The pixel size limits the size of the smallest feature in the image that can be detected. The scintillator, which is used to convert neutrons into visible light, is chosen to \n",
    "1. match the sampling rate given by the pixel size.\n",
    "2. provide sufficient neutron capture to obtain sufficient light output for a given exposure time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Noise\n",
    "An imaging system has many noise sources, each with its own distribution e.g.\n",
    "1. Neutron statistics - how many neutrons are collected in a pixel. This noise is Poisson distributed. \n",
    "2. Photon statistics - how many photons are produced by each neutron. This noise is also Poisson distributed.\n",
    "3. Thermal noise from the electronics which has a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "4. Digitation noise from converting the charges collected for the photons into digital numbers that can be transfered and stored by a computer, this noise has a binominal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The neutron statistics are mostly dominant in neutron imaging but in some cases it could also be that the photon statistics play a role. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contrast\n",
    "The contrast in the sample is a consequence of \n",
    "1. how well the sample transmits the chosen radiation type. For neutrons you obtain good contrast from materials containing hydrogen or lithium while many metals are more transparent.\n",
    "2. the amount of a specific element or material represented in a unit cell, e.g. a pixel (radiograph) or a voxel (tomography). \n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of many experiments is to quantify the amount of a specific material. This could for example be the amount of water in a porous medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good contrast between different image features is important if you want to segment them to make conclusions about the image content. Therefore, the radiation type should be chosen to provide the best contrast between the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inhomogeneous contrast\n",
    "The contrast in the raw radiograph depends much on the beam profile. These variations are easily corrected by normalizing the images by an open beam or flat field image. \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Biases introduced by scattering__ Scattering is the dominant interaction for many materials use in neutron imaging. This means that neutrons that are not passing straight though the sample are scattered and contribute to a background cloud of neutrons that build up a bias of neutron that are also detected and contribute to the \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Biases from beam hardening__ is a problem that is more present in x-ray imaging and is caused by that fact that the attenuation coefficient depends on the energy of the radiation. Higher energies have lower attenuation coefficient, thus will high energies penetrate the thicker samples than lower energies. This can be seen when a polychromatic beam is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Artifacts\n",
    "Many images suffer from outliers caused by stray rays hitting the detector. Typical artefacts in tomography data are\n",
    "- Lines, which are caused by outlier spots that only appear in single projections. These spot appear as lines in the reconstructed images.\n",
    "- Rings are caused by stuck pixels which have the same value in a projections."

This is a downsized version of the original data which has 512x512 image frames. Each frame has a relatively low signal to noise ratio, therefore we use the average image _wtof_ to show the image contents."
